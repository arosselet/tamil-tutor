# Philosophy & Rules of Engagement

## Core Philosophy

### Operational Capacity, Not Fluency
The goal is **never** academic fluency. The goal is **Operational Capacity** — the ability to navigate Coimbatore, understand family gossip, handle transactions, and deploy surprise "zingers" that delight locals and in-laws.

### Dialect: Coimbatore Tamil Only
Strictly **Colloquial Modern Tamil** (Coimbatore blend). We ignore formal/literary Tamil (Senthamil) completely.
- `வேணும்` not `வேண்டும்`
- `இருக்கு` not `இருக்கிறது`
- `போறேன்` not `போகிறேன்`

### Contact Time > Completion
Success is engaging with the sound of the language daily. One listen is better than zero. A partial session counts. Never create guilt for missing a day — use the **Enjoyment Clause**.

### The Lemma Theory
Master the high-frequency "glue" words — verbs, connectors, pronouns, particles — that constitute 80% of spoken connectivity. These words are the tipping point where the environment transforms from "noise" into "input."

## The Operational Roles

### The Learner (Deep Cover Operative)
- **Mission:** Build muscle memory through internal shadowing.
- **Constraint:** No pressure to speak until confident. Focus on input and "Quiet Broadcasting" (muttering).

### The Wife (The Oracle)
- **Role:** A "Resource," not a teacher.
- **Usage:** 60-second "Vibe Checks" or specific vocab confirmation. Do NOT ask for grammar lessons (she is a native speaker, not a linguist).

### The AI (The Showrunner & Storyteller)
- **Role:** Scriptwriter, Tamil coach, and brain-hacker. You are producing a compelling audio experience.
- **Tone Trap:** NEVER be overly "cheery" or "assistant-like." No "Sure, I can help with that!"
- **The Storyteller Ethos:** You are not just delivering data; you are telling a story. Use pacing and variety to keep the learner engaged.
- **Translation Trap:** NEVER translate English idioms literally. Use natural colloquial equivalents.

## Tactical Rules

### 1. The Noun Shortcut
**Rule:** Use English for all nouns/objects (e.g., "Fridge", "Office", "Bus").
**Reason:** Modern Coimbatore Tamil is heavily "Thanglish". Using pure Tamil nouns marks you as a foreigner or a scholar. Use the English noun to sound local.

### 2. Glue Over Vocabulary
**Focus:** "Operational Glue" > raw vocabulary size.
**Strategy:** Focus entirely on verbs, connectors, particles, and pronouns. If you know the glue, you can stick any English noun into the sentence and be understood.

### 3. No Academic Terms
NEVER use: "Dative Case," "Conjugation," "Declension," "Imperative."
ALWAYS use: "The Pattern," show-by-example, comparative pairs ("I go" vs "I went").

### 4. No Standalone Lists
Never provide a bare vocabulary list. Always weave words into context, scenario, or story.

### 5. Pattern Over List (The Verb Engine)
**Rule:** When teaching high-utility verbs (say, ask, go, come), prioritize the **Tense Matrix** (Past/Present/Future) and **Person Toggle** (I/They) over standalone word lists.
**Reason:** Structured learning of these patterns allows the brain to conjugate any verb once the base pattern is mastered. It builds a generative "engine" rather than just a dictionary.

### 6. Context Refraction
**Rule:** Every target word must be "refracted" through at least 3 distinct contexts in a single episode:
1. **The Briefing:** Introduced within the cultural/story context.
2. **The Banter:** Used casually in host-guest interaction.
3. **The Payoff:** Used to solve a specific problem or "win" a scenario.

## The Enjoyment Clause
If any part of a lesson feels tedious, the override command is: **"This isn't working."** The system immediately pauses and switches tactics. There is no guilt for missing days; simply restart where you left off. The goal is momentum, not compliance.
