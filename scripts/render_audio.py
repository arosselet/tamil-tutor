"""
Generate multi-voice Tamil podcast audio from a markdown script.

Usage:
    python scripts/render_audio.py <input_script.md> <output.mp3>

Example:
    python scripts/render_audio.py content/scripts/tier1_mission1.md audio/tier1_mission1.mp3

Reads dialogues prefixed with **Speaker Name:**, generates TTS audio
segments using edge-tts or Google Chirp, and stitches them into a single MP3.
Supports a # Voice Map block in markdown comments for explicit voice assignment.
