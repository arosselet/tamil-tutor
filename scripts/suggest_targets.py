"""
The session "ticket" — the menu Python hands Anna so he never picks words by
eyeballing a 2000-line lexicon. Anna chooses the story and meaning; this script
computes the candidate set. The bright line: Python computes the menu, Anna
makes the choice.

Four parts:
  1. FLOOR-GAP TARGETS — words recognized (comfortable/solid) but not yet firing
     cold. These are what to *force* this session. Ordered most-ready-to-fire
     first (a `hinted` word is one hint from cold; a `solid` word is well-soaked).
  2. DUE CALLBACKS — soft soak targets, reusing generate_callbacks.py (no
     duplicated logic).
  3. NEW CANDIDATES BY CLUSTER — priority-1 word_pool entries not yet in the
     lexicon, grouped by cluster with a coverage stat so Anna can see which
     clusters are thin. Python shows coverage; Anna picks the cluster.
  4. VOCABULARY FENCE — all recognized words (comfortable/solid) plus cold
     productions. This is "the sea" the Architect builds from. Every word of
     dialogue that isn't payload should come from this list.

Usage:
    python scripts/suggest_targets.py [--floor-max 8] [--clusters 5] [--per-cluster 5]
