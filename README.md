# Coimbatore Mappillai — The Audio Architect Protocol

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6853a56-0778-4f3a-a83c-0deaea7bfd68" controls="controls"></video>

**A framework for hacking language learning using LLMs. Built to achieve "Operational Capacity" in Coimbatore Tamil.**

This is not a traditional language course; it is an **Audio-First, Feedback-Driven Engine** designed to build high-utility survival skills for navigating daily life, managing transactions, and thriving in social environments.

## The Philosophy

Traditional language tools prioritize academic literacy over social survival. We aim to break the "Ghost at the Dinner Table" phenomenon through a radically pragmatic approach:

*   **Operational Capacity, Not Fluency:** The goal isn't to hold a debate on philosophy; it's to hail an auto, survive meals with the gounder-in-laws, and drop polite yet sarcastic "nga" zingers.
*   **The 800 Lemmas (The Tipping Point):** We ruthlessly focus on mastering the high-frequency "glue" words (verbs, connectors, pronouns) that constitute 80% of spoken connectivity. Once you know the glue, the environment transforms from "noise" into "input."
*   **Coimbatore Tamil Only:** We strictly teach Modern Colloquial Kongu Tamil (The polite "nga" dialect). We actively ignore formal/literary Tamil (*Senthamil*).
*   **ADHD-Friendly & Dopamine-Driven:**
    *   **Low Friction:** Designed to fit into "dead time" (commuting, chores) via generated audio episodes. 
    *   **The "Deep Cover" Persona:** Grammatical drills are boring. Pretending you're an undercover operative building cover identity skills is not.
    *   **The Enjoyment Clause:** No streaks, no guilt. If a lesson isn't working, the system shifts gears.

## The Architecture (The Code Paradox)

The core "brain" of this repository isn't written in a programming language—it's written in English Markdown. The system relies on prompting an LLM (like Gemini) with highly specific, opinionated personas that act as an automated production studio.

*   **The Director:** Designs the strategy, sets learning goals, and writes the "Beat Sheets" for each lesson.
*   **The Architect:** A creative writer who converts the Beat Sheets into engaging, dual-voice narrative scripts.
*   **The Producer:** A technical executor that ensures TTS compatibility, handles "Kongu" localization, and stitches audio segments.

The output is a dynamic, culturally nuanced Tamil reflex, synthesized into high-quality, dual-voice MP3 podcasts on demand.

## Repository Structure

```
protocol/           → LLM instructions for Gemini (The Brain: Director, Architect, Producer)
curriculum/         → The Roadmap (levels.json)
content/scripts/    → Podcast scripts generated by the LLM (Markdown)
audio/              → Generated MP3 episodes (The Output)
progress/           → Your persistent state (learner.json)
scripts/            → Python tools for generation, synthesis, and packing (The Engine)
```

## Getting Started (How to Use)

This system is managed via the Gemini CLI and operates in two distinct modes depending on the keyword invoked:

1.  **`@build` (The Engineer):** Used for editing the system, writing Python scripts, refining protocols, and managing the curriculum.
2.  **`@tutor` (The Showrunner & Tutor - Default):** Used for running the learning protocol, generating new audio lessons, or conducting interactive teaching sessions.

You can also take the system on the go using the **Portable Version**.

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Authentication**: You have a few options for speech synthesis:
  - **Edge-tts**: No login or API keys required. Works out of the box.
  - **Google Cloud TTS (Default)**: Requires you to be logged in via `gcloud auth login`.
- **Agent Access**: Ensure you are logged into your agent (e.g., `gemini-cli`).
- **Dependencies**:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### 2. The Factory (On your Laptop)
The Factory is where you manage your curriculum and generate audio episodes. You don't need to run complex scripts manually; just **prompt the agent** (e.g., Antigravity or a custom Gemini session):

*   **To check progress:** *"Show my status"* (runs `show_status.py` in the background).
*   **To build a lesson:** *"Generate the audio episode for Level 1 Episode 2."*
*   **To refactor:** *"I'm struggling with X, update my curriculum to drill it more."*

### 3. The Portable Version (On your Phone)
Take your lessons into the wild using the Gemini app. The repository automatically packs everything it needs into a `mobile_bundle.zip`.

1.  **Start a Lesson**: Upload the `mobile_bundle.zip` to a Gemini session on your phone and type: `[Tamil Lesson]`.
2.  **Set the Vibe**: Tell the agent your energy level:
    *   **Low Energy**: *"I'm tired, just play the stream."* (Passive listening/translation).
    *   **Medium Energy**: *"Standard session, let's talk."* (Light conversation).
    *   **High Energy**: *"I'm ready. Use 'The Spy' mode."* (Active drills and simulations).
3.  **Real-Time Drills**: In a mobile session, you can say: *"I'm at the market right now, simulate a transaction for me."*

### Mastering the Prompts
The true power of this system is in **what you ask the agent**. Don't just follow the levels—steer the ship:
- *"Explain the difference between 'Iru' and 'Vaa' like I'm a local."*
- *"Give me 5 'Doorway Zingers' for today based on what I just learned."*
- *"Run a 'Boss Fight' simulation where I have to negotiate an auto fare in Coimbatore."*

### 4. The Podcast Feed (On your Phone)
The easiest way to take your lessons on the go is via a standard **Podcast App** (Apple Podcasts, Overcast, etc.).

1.  **Subscribe**: Copy this URL and add it via "Add Show by URL" in your app:
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arosselet/tamil-tutor/main/rss.xml`
2.  **Listen**: New episodes automatically appear in your feed as soon as they are pushed to GitHub.
3.  **Visuals**: Includes full metadata and the bilingual **Coimbatore Mappilai** cover art.
