# Coimbatore Mappillai — The Audio Architect Protocol

<video src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6aa1d13a-7046-46e5-83ef-1fffa4fbfd84" controls="controls"></video>

**A framework for hacking language learning using LLMs. Built to achieve "Operational Capacity" in Coimbatore Tamil.**

This is not a traditional language course; it is an **Audio-First, Feedback-Driven Engine** designed to build high-utility survival skills for navigating daily life, managing transactions, and thriving in social environments.

## The Philosophy

Traditional language tools prioritize academic literacy over social survival. We aim to break the "Ghost at the Dinner Table" phenomenon through a radically pragmatic approach:

*   **Operational Capacity, Not Fluency:** The goal isn't to hold a debate on philosophy; it's to hail an auto, survive meals with the gounder-in-laws, and drop polite yet sarcastic "nga" zingers.
*   **The 800 Lemmas (The Tipping Point):** We ruthlessly focus on mastering the high-frequency "glue" words (verbs, connectors, pronouns) that constitute 80% of spoken connectivity. Once you know the glue, the environment transforms from "noise" into "input."
*   **Coimbatore Tamil Only:** We strictly teach Modern Colloquial Kongu Tamil (The polite "nga" dialect). We actively ignore formal/literary Tamil (*Senthamil*).
*   **ADHD-Friendly & Dopamine-Driven:**
    *   **Low Friction:** Designed to fit into "dead time" (commuting, chores) via generated audio episodes. 
    *   **The "Deep Cover" Persona:** Grammatical drills are boring. Pretending you're an undercover operative building cover identity skills is not.
    *   **The Enjoyment Clause:** No streaks, no guilt. If a lesson isn't working, the system shifts gears.

## The Architecture (The Code Paradox)

The core "brain" of this repository isn't written in a programming language—it's written in English Markdown. The system relies on prompting an LLM (like Gemini) with highly specific, opinionated personas that act as an automated production studio.

*   **The Director:** Designs the strategy, sets learning goals, and writes the "Beat Sheets" for each lesson.
*   **The Architect:** A creative writer who converts the Beat Sheets into engaging, dual-voice narrative scripts.
*   **The Producer:** A technical executor that ensures TTS compatibility, handles "Kongu" localization, and stitches audio segments.

The output is a dynamic, culturally nuanced Tamil reflex, synthesized into high-quality, dual-voice MP3 podcasts on demand.

## Repository Structure

```
protocol/           → LLM instructions for Gemini (The Brain: Director, Architect, Producer)
curriculum/         → The Roadmap (levels.json)
content/scripts/    → Podcast scripts generated by the LLM (Markdown)
audio/              → Generated MP3 episodes (The Output)
progress/           → Your persistent state (learner.json)
scripts/            → Python tools for generation, synthesis, and packing (The Engine)
```

## Quick Start (The Factory)

Generate dynamic episodes locally on your machine based on your current `learner.json` progress state.

```bash
# 1. Install constraints for TTS and Webhooks
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Check your current learning progress
python scripts/show_status.py

# 3. Generate a synthetic audio episode from an LLM-created script
python scripts/generate_episode.py content/scripts/level1_ep1.md audio/level1_ep1.mp3
```

## The Daily Loop & Mobile Sync

This system is built specifically to bridge the gap between desktop generation and mobile, on-the-go consumption. You don't need to know "what's next." The system tracks your state. 

1. **Pack the Context**: Run `python scripts/pack_mobile.py` to create a `mobile_bundle.zip` of your current curriculum and progress.
2. **Transfer to Mobile**: Upload the bundle to Gemini on your phone.
3. **Trigger the Session**: Tell Gemini `[Tamil Lesson]` and state your current energy:
    *   *Low Energy Day?* "Just give me a light review." (System generates an audit session).
    *   *Frustrated?* "I keep mixing up 'Iru' and 'Illai'." (System creates a specialized disambiguation loop).
4. **Log the Feedback**: The LLM will output a JSON blob of the words you conquered or struggled with. Sync it via a Home Assistant webhook or paste it back to your laptop to update the central state.

*"Contact Time > Completion. Success is engaging with the sound of the language daily. Use the English noun to sound local. Master the operational glue."*
