# Script: Level 3, Episode 1 — Urban Survival

**Host:** Okay. You can survive inside the house. You can eat, you can greet, you can say No without dying. But the moment you step outside? You're a baby again. Today, we put you in an auto rickshaw.

**Guest:** I've been dreading this.

**Host:** The auto is the final exam of Tamil survival. The driver doesn't care about your feelings. He doesn't care about your accent. He wants three things: where, which way, and when to stop. That's it. Let's give you those three things.

---

**Host:** Direction one. Right.

**Guest:** வலது.

**Host:** வலது. Direction two. Left.

**Guest:** இடது.

**Host:** இடது. Direction three. Straight. Just keep going.

**Guest:** நேரா.

**Host:** நேரா. And the emergency brake. Stop.

**Guest:** நிறுத்துங்க.

**Host:** நிறுத்துங்க. Notice the "unga" at the end? That's the respect suffix. You don't bark "stop" at the driver. You say "please stop." நிறுத்துங்க.

**Guest:** நிறுத்துங்க.

**Host:** Let's simulate. You're in the auto. The wind is hitting your face. The meter is definitely not running. You see your street coming up on the right. What do you say?

**Guest:** வலது.

**Host:** Good. He turns right. Now you see the house but he's going too far. You need to go left first.

**Guest:** இடது.

**Host:** He turns left. There's your building. Right there.

**Guest:** நிறுத்துங்க!

**Host:** Perfect. Three words and you've navigated an auto rickshaw.

---

**Host:** Now. Commerce. You cannot eat if you cannot count. And you cannot count if you don't know the numbers. Here are the only numbers you need to survive.

**Guest:** All of them?

**Host:** No. Six. That's it. One.

**Guest:** ஒன்னு.

**Host:** Two.

**Guest:** ரெண்டு.

**Host:** Three.

**Guest:** மூணு.

**Host:** Five.

**Guest:** அஞ்சு.

**Host:** Ten.

**Guest:** பத்து.

**Host:** And hundred.

**Guest:** நூறு.

**Host:** Wait, what happened to four?

**Guest:** You skipped it.

**Host:** I did. Because in street Tamil, you don't need four very often. You need one, two, three for ordering food. Five and ten for prices. And hundred for auto fares. That's the survival set.

**Guest:** ஒன்னு, ரெண்டு, மூணு, அஞ்சு, பத்து, நூறு.

**Host:** Quick drill. You walk into a tea stall. You want two teas.

**Guest:** ரெண்டு tea.

**Host:** You want three idlis.

**Guest:** மூணு idli.

**Host:** The bill is ten rupees.

**Guest:** பத்து.

**Host:** You hand over a hundred rupee note.

**Guest:** நூறு.

**Host:** See? Numbers plus English nouns. That's all street commerce is.

---

**Host:** Now the money talk. The question every customer must know.

**Guest:** How much?

**Host:** In Tamil.

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** எவ்வளவு? You point at the mangoes. எவ்வளவு? You look at the auto meter. எவ்வளவு? You pick up a shirt. எவ்வளவு?

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** Good. Now the shopkeeper says a number. It's always too high. Always. Your weapon:

**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி.

**Host:** ஜாஸ்தி. Too much. He says 500 for bananas. You say...

**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி!

**Host:** Now you negotiate. You want less.

**Guest:** கம்மி.

**Host:** கம்மி. Less. And one more. Money. The word itself.

**Guest:** காசு.

**Host:** காசு. Money. "காசு இல்ல" — I don't have money. Very useful when beggars approach you. Very dangerous when your wife hears it.

**Guest:** காசு இல்ல.

**Host:** Let's roleplay. I'm the fruit vendor. You approach me. I have beautiful apples. You pick one up.

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** நூறு ரூபாய்.

**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி!

**Host:** Okay fine. எவ்வளவு வேணும்?

**Guest:** கம்மி. அஞ்சு பத்து ரூபாய்.

**Host:** Hmm, your negotiation is creative but messy. That's fine. That's how it works in real life.

---

**Host:** Now. Where exactly are things? Your wife asks "where's my phone?" You need to say more than just "there." You need prepositions.

**Guest:** Tamil has prepositions?

**Host:** Tamil has postpositions. They come after the noun, not before. Near someone. With someone.

**Guest:** கிட்ட.

**Host:** கிட்ட. On top. Above.

**Guest:** மேல.

**Host:** மேல. Below. Under.

**Guest:** கீழ.

**Host:** கீழ. Inside.

**Guest:** உள்ள.

**Host:** உள்ள. And outside.

**Guest:** வெளிய.

**Host:** வெளிய. Now. Your wife screams "where's my phone?!" You can see it. It's inside the bag.

**Guest:** Bag உள்ள இருக்கு.

**Host:** Brilliant. The bag is on the table.

**Guest:** Table மேல இருக்கு.

**Host:** Your key is with your friend Raj.

**Guest:** Raj கிட்ட இருக்கு.

**Host:** The cat is under the sofa.

**Guest:** Sofa கீழ இருக்கு.

**Host:** The auto is outside.

**Guest:** Auto வெளிய இருக்கு.

**Host:** You just described an entire house using five words and the one verb you already knew — இருக்கு. That's the Tamil cheat code. Postposition plus இருக்கு. Done.

---

**Host:** Boss fight. Full simulation. You are leaving the house. You need to take an auto to the market. Buy fruit. Come home. Let's go. You step outside. You see an auto.

**Guest:** Auto! இங்க வாருங்க!

**Host:** Good improvisation. He pulls up. He asks where.

**Guest:** Market போலாம்.

**Host:** He starts driving. You need to go straight for a while.

**Guest:** நேரா.

**Host:** You see the market up ahead, turn right.

**Guest:** வலது.

**Host:** Almost there. There, right there!

**Guest:** நிறுத்துங்க!

**Host:** You're at the fruit stand. You pick up mangoes. You ask the price.

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** He says "Nooru." Hundred each.

**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி! கம்மி?

**Host:** He says fifty. You want three.

**Guest:** மூணு வேணும்.

**Host:** He puts them in a bag. You ask about the meter for the auto ride back.

**Guest:** மீட்டர் போடுங்க.

**Host:** Ha! Where did you learn that?

**Guest:** It was in the curriculum.

**Host:** Good memory. And one last phrase. You tell the auto driver, let's go.

**Guest:** போலாம்.

**Host:** போலாம். And when you need change?

**Guest:** சில்லறை?

**Host:** You survived the market. You navigated two auto rides. You negotiated fruit prices. You are officially street-ready.

---

**Host:** Today's Zinger. The phrase you mutter at every doorway.

**Guest:** What is it?

**Host:** எவ்வளவு? எவ்வளவு? எவ்வளவு? Every doorway. Three times. Let the customer inside you wake up.

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** எவ்வளவு?

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** You now have directions, numbers, money, and space. The streets of Coimbatore are yours.
