# Script: Level 4, Episode 4 (Remix) — The Logic Loop

[Scene: Upbeat, investigative intro music fades]

**Host:** Welcome back to the Dojo. We are doing a remix session today. Same tools, new scenario. You wanted more practice with the Logic Connectors.

**Guest:** The glue. Because, Therefore, But, That's why.

**Host:** Exactly. But we're also going to clear out some of the rust on your other words. You've been struggling with "Outside" (Veliya), "Near" (Kitta), and "Less" (Kammi). We're going to weave them in.

**Guest:** Let's do it.

**Host:** The Scenario: "The Broken Promise". You promised to meet your friend *outside* the cinema. But you didn't go. Now you are on the phone explaining why.

**Guest:** High stakes.

**Host:** First, let's review the struggling words. "Outside". Veliya.

**Guest:** வெளிய (Veliya).

**Host:** "Near". Kitta.

**Guest:** கிட்ட (Kitta).

**Host:** "Less" or "Low". Kammi.

**Guest:** கம்மி (Kammi).

**Host:** Okay, ring ring. Pick up the phone. Your friend asks: "Where are you?" You say: "I am near the house." Use 'Kitta'.

**Guest:** நான் வீட்டு கிட்ட இருக்கேன்.

**Host:** Friend asks: "Why didn't you come?" You say: "Because... work." Use 'Yenna'.

**Guest:** ஏன்னா... வொர்க்.

**Host:** Now expand it. "Because work was heavy."

**Guest:** ஏன்னா வொர்க் ஹெவி.

**Host:** Friend is angry. "I was waiting outside!" You say: "I know. But... no charge in phone." Use 'Aanaa'.

**Guest:** எனக்கு தெரியும். ஆனா... போன்ல சார்ஜ் இல்ல.

**Host:** Friend says: "You should have called." You say: "Charge was less. That's why." Use 'Kammi' and 'Adhaan'.

**Guest:** சார்ஜ் கம்மி. அதான்.

**Host:** See that? "Charge Kammi. Adhaan." Logic and quantifier in two seconds. Let's try that again. Shadow me. சார்ஜ் கம்மி. அதான்.

**Guest:** சார்ஜ் கம்மி. அதான்.

**Host:** Now let's try the "Therefore" connector. Adhanaala.

**Guest:** அதனால.

**Host:** "Money is less. Therefore I didn't buy." Use 'Kammi' and 'Adhanaala'.

**Guest:** காசு கம்மி. அதனால நான் வாங்கல.

**Host:** "Traffic is heavy outside. That's why I am late." Use 'Veliya' and 'Adhaan'.

**Guest:** வெளிய டிராஃபிக் ஹெவி. அதான் லேட்.

**Host:** Good. "He is near. Therefore I cannot talk." Use 'Kitta'.

**Guest:** அவரு கிட்ட இருக்காரு. அதனால பேச முடியாது.

**Host:** Excellent. You're mixing spatial words with logic words. This is complex stuff.

**Host:** Boss Fight: The Explanation. I am your friend. I am shouting. You need to calm me down using logic.

**Guest:** Ready.

**Host:** "Dei! Why are you not here?" -> Tell me: "Because... rain outside."

**Guest:** ஏன்னா... வெளிய மழை.

**Host:** "So what? You have a car!" -> Tell me: "But... petrol is less."

**Guest:** ஆனா... பெட்ரோல் கம்மி.

**Host:** "Aiyyo! You should have filled it!" -> Tell me: "Shop is near. Therefore I am going now."

**Guest:** ஷாப் கிட்ட இருக்கு. அதனால இப்போ போறேன்.

**Host:** "Okay, come fast." -> Tell me: "That's why I cut the call."

**Guest:** அதான் கட் பண்றேன்.

**Host:** Boom. Argument won. You used Veliya, Kammi, Kitta, Yenna, Aanaa, Adhanaala, and Adhaan.

**Guest:** I feel like a lawyer.

**Host:** That's the point. Logic is power. Keep practicing these loops. "This happened, therefore that." "I wanted this, but that." See you next time.
