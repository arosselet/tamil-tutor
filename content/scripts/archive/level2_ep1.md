# Script: Level 2, Episode 1 — Domestic Defense

**Host:** Welcome to Week 2. Or, as I like to call it: The Kitchen. 

**Guest:** The most dangerous room in the house.

**Host:** Exactly. In Coimbatore, the kitchen is where you win or lose the war of hospitality. Your mother-in-law is watching you. The host's wife is watching you. And they are all holding a ladle full of sambar. 

**Guest:** So how do I survive?

**Host:** You survive by giving feedback. Silence in the kitchen is seen as suspicion. If you're quiet, they think you hate the food. If they think you hate the food, they'll give you more.

**Guest:** Wait, more?

**Host:** Yes. It's the hospitality paradox. "Oh, he's quiet, he must be too shy to ask for more. Give him three more dosas!" 

---

**Host:** Today, we learn the shields. The positive feedback loops that keep the food coming, but also keep you in their good books. Weapon number one: It's good.

**Guest:** நல்லா இருக்கு.

**Host:** நல்லா இருக்கு. Say it like you mean it.

**Guest:** நல்லா இருக்கு!

**Host:** Good. Now, when it's better than good. When it's high-fives and celebration levels.

**Guest:** சூப்பர்!

**Host:** 슈퍼. Simple. Everyone knows it. And the local favorite — awesome, extreme, next-level.

**Guest:** செம்ம.

**Host:** செம்ம. This word is the ultimate praise for a home-cooked meal. "Semma taste!" 

**Guest:** செம்ம.

---

**Host:** Now, the logic of the plate. Sometimes, the food is a bit much. Specifically, the spice.

**Guest:** காரம்.

**Host:** காரம். Spicy. Use this with a slightly pained expression. 

**Guest:** காரம்!

**Host:** And salt.

**Guest:** உப்பு.

**Host:** உப்பு. Salt or salty. If you need more salt, you point and say "Uppu." If there's too much, you say "Uppu jaisthi." Use the word we learned last week for "too much."

**Guest:** உப்பு ஜாஸ்தி!

---

**Host:** Let's drill. You're at the table. Your mother-in-law pours rasam over your rice. She looks at you, waiting.

**Guest:** நல்லா இருக்கு.

**Host:** She smiles. She brings out the special mutton curry she's been cooking for four hours.

**Guest:** செம்ம!

**Host:** You take a bite. It's like a volcano exploded in your mouth.

**Guest:** காரம்! காரம்!

**Host:** She looks worried. She offers you curd to cool it down. 

**Guest:** சூப்பர்.

**Host:** See? You're navigating the emotions of the meal.

---

**Host:** Now, let's talk about the flow. In a Tamil house, food doesn't come in one plate. It's a continuous stream. You need the word for "Enough." The most important shield in your arsenal.

**Guest:** போதும்.

**Host:** போதும். Enough. Stop. No more. 

**Guest:** போதும்.

**Host:** And if you want just a little bit more. Just to be polite.

**Guest:** கொஞ்சம்.

**Host:** கொஞ்சம். A little. "Konjam podhum" — just a little is enough.

**Guest:** கொஞ்சம் போதும்.

---

**Host:** Time works differently in the kitchen too. They want you to eat now. You want to eat later. 

**Guest:** அப்புறம்.

**Host:** அப்புறம். Later. After that. 

**Guest:** இப்போ.

**Host:** இப்போ. Now. 

**Guest:** நாளைக்கு.

**Host:** நாளைக்கு. Tomorrow. Using these helps you defer the infinite feeding cycle. "Appram saapidren" — I'll eat later.

---

**Host:** Boss fight. You're seated. The banana leaf is open. The host is approaching with a bucket of spicy potato curry. 

**Guest:** கொஞ்சம் போதும்.

**Host:** He gives you a tiny bit. You taste it. It's amazing.

**Guest:** செம்ம!

**Host:** He tries to give you a mountain of rice.

**Guest:** இல்ல இல்ல, போதும்!

**Host:** He asks how the sambar is.

**Guest:** நல்லா இருக்கு.

**Host:** He offers you another sweet. You're full.

**Guest:** அப்புறம் சாப்பிடுறேன்.

**Host:** Excellent. You just survived a Sunday lunch without offending anyone or exploding.

---

**Host:** Today's Zinger. The phrase you mutter at every doorway. The highest form of kitchen praise.

**Guest:** What is it?

**Host:** செம்ம! செம்ம! செம்ம! Every doorway. Mutter it three times. Let the energy of a perfect meal carry you through the day.

**Guest:** செம்ம!

**Host:** செம்ம!

**Guest:** செம்ம!

**Host:** Stay hungry. But stay in control.
