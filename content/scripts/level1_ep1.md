# Script: Level 1, Episode 1 — First Contact

**Host:** Alright. Day one. Zero words. You walk into a Coimbatore house for the first time. The door opens, and there's a woman standing there, looking at you like you're a courier delivery that showed up early. What do you say?

**Guest:** Uh... Hi?

**Host:** No. You say one word. The only word that matters.

**Guest:** வணக்கம்.

**Host:** That's it. That one word does three things. It says hello, it shows respect, and it tells them you're not completely useless.

**Guest:** வணக்கம்.

**Host:** Good. Now she smiles. She asks you something in Tamil. You understand nothing. But here's the trick — you don't need to understand everything. You need to understand two words.

**Guest:** Which two?

**Host:** Yes and No. In Tamil, Yes is...

**Guest:** ஆமா.

**Host:** And No is...

**Guest:** இல்ல.

**Host:** That's it. With these two words, you can survive any conversation. She asks "Did you eat?" — ஆமா. She asks "Do you want more?" — இல்ல. She asks "Are you comfortable?" — ஆமா.

**Guest:** What if I don't understand the question?

**Host:** Then you need one more word. The safety net. The magic word that buys you time.

**Guest:** What is it?

**Host:** Sari.

**Guest:** சரி.

**Host:** Sari doesn't mean "I agree." It means "I acknowledge." It means "I heard you." It means "Let's move on." When someone says something and you have no idea what they said, you nod and say...

**Guest:** சரி.

**Host:** Perfect. Let me test you. I'm your neighbor. I just knocked on your door. I say something in Tamil you don't understand.

**Guest:** சரி.

**Host:** I ask if you're settling in okay.

**Guest:** ஆமா.

**Host:** I ask if you need anything from the shop.

**Guest:** இல்ல.

**Host:** I smile and start to leave. What do you say?

**Guest:** வணக்கம்.

**Host:** You just survived your first Tamil conversation with four words. வணக்கம். ஆமா. இல்ல. சரி. That's your survival kit. The rest is just decoration.

**Host:** Let's drill these. I'll throw situations at you. You respond with one of your four words. Ready?

**Guest:** ஆமா.

**Host:** See? You're already using it. Someone offers you coffee.

**Guest:** ஆமா.

**Host:** Someone asks if you speak Tamil fluently.

**Guest:** இல்ல.

**Host:** Someone explains the bus schedule to you for five minutes.

**Guest:** சரி.

**Host:** You walk into a room full of strangers.

**Guest:** வணக்கம்.

**Host:** Someone asks if you want to try the fish curry.

**Guest:** இல்ல.

**Host:** Careful. That might offend. Try again.

**Guest:** ஆமா?

**Host:** Better. In this house, saying Yes to food is always the right answer. Even if you're full. Even if you're dying. You say...

**Guest:** ஆமா.

**Host:** And when you've had enough?

**Guest:** சரி.

**Host:** Good. சரி is your escape hatch from everything. "More rice?" — சரி. "Come visit again" — சரி. "Let me tell you about my nephew's wedding" — சரி.

**Host:** Today's Zinger. The one phrase you mutter every time you walk through a doorway. Ready?

**Guest:** ஆமா.

**Host:** Your Zinger is: வணக்கம். Every doorway, every threshold, mutter it three times. வணக்கம், வணக்கம், வணக்கம்.

**Guest:** வணக்கம், வணக்கம், வணக்கம்.

**Host:** Welcome to Coimbatore. You have four words. You are dangerous.
