# Script: Demo — Hacking the Brain (The Tamil2 Protocol)

**Host:** Most people think language learning is about vocabulary size. They want to know five thousand words. We think that’s a trap. We focus on the **800 Lemmas**.

**Guest:** 800? That sounds... small.

**Host:** It’s tiny. But it’s the **Glue**. In any language, about 800 words—verbs, connectors, pronouns—handle 80% of the connectivity. If you master the glue, you can use English for every single noun and you’ll be 90% understood in Chennai.

**Guest:** So I don't need to learn the word for "Computer" or "Electricity"?

**Host:** Absolutely not. In fact, if you use the pure Tamil word for "Electricity"—*minsaaram*—people will look at you like you’re reading from a textbook. Just say "Current" or "Power." That’s the **Thanglish Hack**. We’re not teaching you to be a scholar; we’re teaching you **Operational Capacity**.

**Guest:** But how do I actually *remember* it? My brain usually rejects this stuff after three days.

**Host:** That’s where we hack the learning loop. We use a **Sandwich structure**. We start with a **Hook**—a sensory-rich scenario. We don't say "Today we learn directions." We say "You’re in a hot auto-rickshaw, it smells like diesel and jasmine, and you need to tell the driver to stop before he misses your turn."

**Guest:** I can feel that. *Niruthunga!* (Stop!)

**Host:** Exactly. Then we hit the **Mechanics**, then the **Drill**, and we end with a **Simulation**. A Boss Fight. The AI isn't just a tutor; it’s a **Handler**. It tracks your "Focus Meter." If you’re tired, it drops to "The Stream"—passive listening. If you’re high energy, it throws you into a "Vendor Stare-down."

**Guest:** And what’s this I hear about muttering at doorways?

**Host:** **Quiet Broadcasting**. This is the ultimate brain hack. We pick one "Zinger" a day. You don't "study" it. You just mutter it three times whenever you cross a physical threshold—a doorway, a car door, the stairs. 

**Guest:** Why?

**Host:** It anchors the sound to a physical movement. It moves the language from your "study brain" into your "muscle memory." By the time you’re actually in Chennai, the words don't come from your head—they come from your feet.

**Guest:** So it’s less about "learning" and more about "installing" a new operating system?

**Host:** Exactly. Little by little. **கொஞ்சம் கொஞ்சம்** (*Konjam konjam*). We aren't hacking the language. We’re hacking **you**.
