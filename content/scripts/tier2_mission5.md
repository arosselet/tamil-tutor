# Beat Sheet: Tier 2 Mission 5 - BOSS FIGHT: The Evening Report

## Intel Briefing

- **Mission**: Your family (Mom, Dad, Spouse) is waiting. They will ask you about your day. You cannot just give one-word answers. You must build a **Narrative Chain**.
- **Goal**: Survive the interrogation by linking actions with time (First/Next) and logic (Because/So).

## Beat 1: The Arsenal Check (Warm-up)
- **Goal**: Prime the past tense verbs.
- **Drill**:
    - I went -> Naan Ponen.
    - I came -> Naan Vanthen.
    - I did -> Naan Panninen.
    - I ate -> Naan Saappitten.
    - **Zinger Check**: "Saptiya?" (Did you eat?). Reply: "Saptane" (I ate).

## Beat 2: The Glue Factory (Sequencing)
- **Goal**: Prime the chronology markers.
- **Drill**:
    - First -> Mudhalla.
    - After that -> Adhukku Appuram.

    - **Concept**: "Mudhalla [Action 1]. Adhukku appuram [Action 2]."

## Beat 3: The Logic Gate (Causality)
- **Goal**: Prime the reasoning connectors.
- **Drill**:
    - Because -> Aenna.
    - Therefore -> Adhanaala.
    - But -> Aana.
    - **Pattern**: "Traffic irundhuchu (There was traffic), *adhanaala* late aachu (therefore it became late)."

## Beat 4: Scenario - The Entry (Mom)
- **Setting**: Doorway. Mom is there.
- **Interaction**:
    - Mom: "Vanthuttiya?" (You came?) -> You: "Vanthen." (I came).
    - Mom: "Saptiya?" -> You: "Innum illa." (Not yet) or "Saptane."
    - Mom: "Mudhalla poi kai kazhuvu." (First go wash your hands).

    - Dad: "Innaikku office-la enna aachu?" (What happened at office today?)
    - **Challenge**: Construct a 3-part chain.
        1. "Mudhalla meeting panninen." (First I did a meeting).
        2. "Adhukku appuram lunch saptane." (After that I ate lunch).
        3. "Appuram vela panninen." (Then I did work).

## Beat 6: Scenario - The Interrogation (Spouse)
- **Setting**: Spouse is suspicious/curious.
- **Interaction**:
    - Spouse: "Yen ivlo late?" (Why so late?)
    - **Challenge**: Use the "Because" or "Therefore" logic.
    - You: "Meeting irundhuchu (There was a meeting), *adhanaala* late aachu." (Therefore it became late).
    - Spouse: "Munnadiye solla maatiya?" (Won't you say it before?).
    - You: "Phone charge illa, *aenna* current illa." (No phone charge because no power).

## Beat 7: The Struggle Weave
- **Goal**: Integrate struggled words naturally.
- **Interaction**:
    - "Office *kitta* traffic-a?" (Traffic *near* office?) -> Validate "Kitta".
    - "Pattu manikka?" (At 10 o'clock?) -> Validate "Pattu" (Ten).
    - "Nuru rooba kudu." (Give 100 rupees). -> Validate "Nuru" (100).

## Beat 8: Victory Lap
- **Goal**: The final uninterrupted monologue.
