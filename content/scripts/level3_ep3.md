# Script: Level 3, Episode 3 — Transactions

**Host:** Alright. You have your numbers. You can count to ten, you can count to a hundred. But numbers are just math. Today, we turn math into money.

**Guest:** The fun part.

**Host:** Or the stressful part, depending on the vendor. In Chennai, every price is a conversation. Every transaction is a tiny negotiation. If you just pay what they ask, you're not just losing money—you're losing a chance to connect.

**Guest:** So how do I start the conversation?

**Host:** The most important question in the city. How much?

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** எவ்வளவு? You point at the bunch of bananas. எவ்வளவு? You touch the fabric. எவ்வளவு? 

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** Good. Now, the word for money itself. 

**Guest:** காசு.

**Host:** காசு. You'll hear this everywhere. "Kaasu illai" — I don't have money. "Chillarai kaasu" — change. 

**Guest:** காசு.

**Host:** Now, the negotiation. The vendor tells you the price. It's always a shock. Even if it's fair, you should act a little shocked. Your shield: Too much.

**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி.

**Host:** ஜாஸ்தி! Say it like you just saw a ghost.

**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி!

**Host:** Perfect. Now you ask for the antidote. Less.

**Guest:** கம்மி.

**Host:** கம்மி. You're asking "Can you make it less?" "Konjam kammi?"

**Guest:** கொஞ்சம் கம்மி?

**Host:** Let's roleplay. I'm a mango seller. I look very professional. You pick up a nice, ripe Alphonso.

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** I say: Iru-nooru. Two hundred.

**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி!

**Host:** I shrug. "Quality fruits, sir." You ask for less.

**Guest:** கொஞ்சம் கம்மி பண்ணுங்க.

**Host:** Wow, look at you adding "pannunga" (please do). He says okay, 150. You're winning.

---

**Host:** One more thing. Sometimes, it's not about the price. It's about whether they even take your money. If you have only a big note, you ask for change.

**Guest:** சில்லறை இருக்கா?

**Host:** சில்லறை இருக்கா? Is there change? Very useful at 8 AM when you try to pay for a 10-rupee tea with a 500-rupee note.

**Guest:** சில்லறை இருக்கா?

---

**Host:** Boss fight. You're at the Spencer Plaza. You want a souvenir. You see a small brass lamp.

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** Five hundred rupees.

**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி! 

**Host:** Fine, 450.

**Guest:** இன்னும் கம்மி... இருநூறு?

**Host:** Two hundred? He's going to kick you out! But that's' how you learn the boundaries. 

---

**Host:** Today's Zinger. The phrase you mutter at every doorway. The shopper's mantra.

**Guest:** What is it?

**Host:** எவ்வளவு? ஜாஸ்தி. கம்மி. Three times. Every doorway.

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு? ஜாஸ்தி. கம்மி.

**Host:** எவ்வளவு? ஜாஸ்தி. கம்மி.

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு? ஜாஸ்தி. கம்மி.

**Host:** Go out there and save some 'Kaasu'.
