# Showcase: The Tamil Protocol (Coimbatore Mappillai)

**Host:** Welcome to the "Coimbatore Mappillai" project.

**Guest:** The Kongu Engine.

**Host:** Yes. We’re running the core architecture on its home turf.

**Guest:** I’ve been looking at the repo. It’s wild. The core learning loop—the Director, the Producer—is all just English Markdown files.

**Host:** That’s the "Code Paradox." The logic is English text, and there are just a couple of Python scripts to synthesize the audio.

**Guest:** So the instructions are English, but the output is a pure Tamil reflex?

**Guest:** How does it know not to sound like a robot?

**Host:** That’s the power of delegation. We use sub-agents.

**Guest:** Sub-agents?

**Host:** See, if the "Lesson Writer" had to worry about slang and TTS quirks, it would get bogged down. So we unencumber it. The "Director" focuses purely on the teaching logic.

**Guest:** And the "Producer" handles the vibe?

**Host:** Exactly. The Producer is a specialist. Its only job is to take that lesson and translate it for the specific voice. To ensure `சும்மா` sounds like an attitude, not a dictionary entry.

**Guest:** Show me the difference.

**Host:** Okay. Practical example. "Flow." A textbook teaches you "Ideally/Simply". This system teaches you the Kovai shrug. "Just like that." "Whatever." "Quietly."

**Guest:** சும்மா.

**Host:** சும்மா. "Summa." You need a dedicated agent to prioritize that feeling over the raw text.

**Guest:** சும்மா.

**Host:** And you do this... where?

**Guest:** At the kitchen sink.

**Host:** (Laughs) Serious?

**Host:** Deadly serious. I’m washing dishes, scrubbing a pan, and I’m building my "Reflex Deck."

**Guest:** But what are you actually learning? Random words?

**Host:** No. The roadmap is battle-tested.

**Guest:** So Level 1 is...

**Host:** "The Social Scaffold." Existence. Yes, No, Respect. Then Level 2 is "Domestic Defense."

**Guest:** Domestic Defense?

**Host:** Surviving the in-laws' kitchen. How to say "Enough" before you get trapped in the "Infinite Dosa Loop."

**Guest:** (Laughs) That’s a real threat.

**Host:** Then Level 3 is "Urban Survival." Auto commands. Numbers. How to argue with a driver. It’s not academic; it’s tactical.

**Guest:** It tracks you?

**Host:** It tracks everything in `learner.json`. But the "On-Demand Tutor" isn't just a playlist. It's a conversation.

**Guest:** So I can ask it questions?

**Host:** Anything. "Why is it `வேண்டாம்`?" "How do I say this to my boss?" It knows your progress, it knows the curriculum, and it clarifies the nuance instantly.

**Guest:** That’s powerful. And where does this lead? Fluency?

**Host:** Eventually. But the immediate goal is 800 Lemmas.

**Guest:** What’s a Lemma?

**Host:** It’s a root concept. A language has 50,000 words, but you only need a few hundred "Lemmas" to actually connect with people.

**Guest:** So instead of climbing a mountain...

**Host:** You just pick up three pebbles a day. It compounds. The hard part isn't the learning; it's the motivation. This system makes it so easy that you actually *look forward* to doing the dishes.

**Guest:** So how do I start? Do I need to configure a server?

**Host:** No friction. You just press play. You listen. You repeat.

**Guest:** That’s it?

**Host:** That’s the protocol.

**Guest:** சரி.

**Host:** நன்றி.

**Guest:** போயிட்டு வரேன்.
