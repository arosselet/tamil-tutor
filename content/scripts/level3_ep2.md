# Script: Level 3, Episode 2 — The Numbers Game

**Host:** Welcome back. Last time, we put you in an auto and showed you how to steer the driver. Today, we handle the part that usually hurts: the payment.

**Guest:** The numbers?

**Host:** The numbers. But don't worry. This isn't a math class. You don't need to count to a billion. In the streets of Chennai, you only need six numbers to survive 90% of your interactions.

**Guest:** Only six?

**Host:** That's it. Let's start with the basics for ordering food. One.

**Guest:** ஒன்னு.

**Host:** ஒன்னு. Two.

**Guest:** ரெண்டு.

**Host:** ரெண்டு. Three.

**Guest:** மூணு.

**Host:** மூணு. Notice the pattern? One, two, three. ஒன்னு, ரெண்டு, மூணு. Easy.

---

**Host:** Now for the money. You don't usually pay one or two rupees for anything anymore. You usually pay in fives and tens. Five.

**Guest:** அஞ்சு.

**Host:** அஞ்சு. Ten.

**Guest:** பத்து.

**Host:** பத்து. And the big one for the auto drivers. Hundred.

**Guest:** நூறு.

**Host:** நூறு. If you have these six, you can buy idlis, pay for an auto, and check your change.

---

**Host:** Let's practice ordering. You're at a tea stall. You want two teas.

**Guest:** ரெண்டு tea.

**Host:** Good. You want one vada.

**Guest:** ஒன்னு vada.

**Host:** Now the bill comes. It's ten rupees.

**Guest:** பத்து?

**Host:** Exactly. You hand over a hundred.

**Guest:** நூறு.

---

**Host:** Here's a pro-tip. When you're in an auto, the driver will often skip the smaller numbers. If he says "Anju," he doesn't mean five rupees. He means fifty. If he says "Pathu," he might mean a hundred. But for now, focus on the base numbers.

**Guest:** அஞ்சு, பத்து, நூறு.

**Host:** Exactly. 

---

**Host:** Boss fight time. You've reached your destination. You're at a fruit stall. You want three apples.

**Guest:** மூணு apple.

**Host:** The vendor says the price is hundred rupees.

**Guest:** நூறு?

**Host:** Yes. You think it's too much. Remember our word from last time?

**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி!

**Host:** He laughs. He says fine, fifty. But you only want two apples now.

**Guest:** அப்புறம்... இல்ல. ரெண்டு apple.

**Host:** Good correction. And how much for two? He says thirty.

**Guest:** மூணு... இல்ல, பத்து?

**Host:** Thirty would be three tens. So "Muppadhu," but we haven't learned that yet. Just say the numbers you know. If you're stuck, use your fingers and say:

**Guest:** பத்து, பத்து, பத்து?

**Host:** Ha! That actually works. Three tens. Brilliant.

---

**Host:** Today's Zinger. The phrase you mutter at every doorway.

**Guest:** What is it?

**Host:** ஒன்னு, ரெண்டு, மூணு. அஞ்சு, பத்து, நூறு. Just run the sequence. Make it muscle memory.

**Guest:** ஒன்னு, ரெண்டு, மூணு. அஞ்சு, பத்து, நூறு.

**Host:** ஒன்னு, ரெண்டு, மூணு. அஞ்சு, பத்து, நூறு.

**Guest:** ஒன்னு, ரெண்டு, மூணு. அஞ்சு, பத்து, நூறு.

**Host:** You're ready to shop. Go out there and spend some money.
