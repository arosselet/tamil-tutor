# Script: Level 4, Episode 1 — The Debrief

**Host:** Alright. You know how to survive Chennai. You can greet people, eat food, take autos. Congratulations. You're a tourist.

**Guest:** Ouch.

**Host:** Here's the problem. Right now, you can say "I want coffee." You can say "give me." You can point and grunt and survive. But the moment someone asks you "What did you do today?" — you're dead. You can't answer. You're stuck in the present tense like a goldfish.

**Guest:** So we're learning past tense?

**Host:** We're learning how to tell a story. And in Tamil, stories are dead simple. You take the verb, you change the ending, and suddenly you were there.

---

**Host:** Let's start with the verb you already know. போறேன். I'm going. Right?

**Guest:** போறேன்.

**Host:** Now. I went. The past tense. This is the single most important verb form you'll learn today.

**Guest:** போனேன்.

**Host:** போனேன். Say it again.

**Guest:** போனேன்.

**Host:** Beautiful. போறேன் becomes போனேன். I'm going becomes I went. Now the opposite. I'm coming — வரேன். I came?

**Guest:** வந்தேன்.

**Host:** வந்தேன். Perfect. These two are your bread and butter. Where did you go? I went. போனேன். When did you come back? I came. வந்தேன்.

---

**Host:** Next. The most versatile verb in Tamil. I did. This is your cheat code. If you don't know the specific past tense verb, you just say "I did" plus the thing.

**Guest:** பண்ணினேன்.

**Host:** பண்ணினேன். I did. "Work பண்ணினேன்" — I did work. "Shopping பண்ணினேன்" — I did shopping. See how the English noun just slots in? That's the Thanglish magic.

**Guest:** பண்ணினேன்.

**Host:** And one more. I gave.

**Guest:** கொடுத்தேன்.

**Host:** கொடுத்தேன். "Money கொடுத்தேன்" — I gave money. "Key கொடுத்தேன்" — I gave the key.

---

**Host:** Let's drill. I'll describe a situation. You respond with what you did. Ready? You left the house this morning. Where did you go?

**Guest:** Office போனேன்.

**Host:** Your friend called and asked where you were. You said "I came to office."

**Guest:** Office வந்தேன்.

**Host:** Boss gave you a task. You finished it. What did you do?

**Guest:** Work பண்ணினேன்.

**Host:** Your colleague needed the report. What did you do?

**Guest:** Report கொடுத்தேன்.

**Host:** See? Four verbs and you just told me your entire work day. போனேன், வந்தேன், பண்ணினேன், கொடுத்தேன்.

---

**Host:** Now the consumption verbs. These are the ones your family actually cares about. Nobody asks about your work. They ask about your food. I ate.

**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டேன்.

**Host:** சாப்பிட்டேன். I drank.

**Guest:** குடிச்சேன்.

**Host:** குடிச்சேன். I saw. Or I watched. Same word in Tamil.

**Guest:** பார்த்தேன்.

**Host:** பார்த்தேன். And the two verbs for the lazy man. I slept.

**Guest:** தூங்கினேன்.

**Host:** And I woke up.

**Guest:** எழுந்தேன்.

**Host:** Quick drill. Your wife calls at 3pm. She asks about your day. You woke up at 7.

**Guest:** ஏழு மணிக்கு எழுந்தேன்.

**Host:** You drank coffee.

**Guest:** Coffee குடிச்சேன்.

**Host:** You ate breakfast.

**Guest:** Breakfast சாப்பிட்டேன்.

**Host:** You watched a meeting on Zoom. What did you do?

**Guest:** Meeting பார்த்தேன்.

**Host:** And after lunch?

**Guest:** தூங்கினேன்.

**Host:** Ha! At least you're honest.

---

**Host:** Now here's where it gets powerful. You have the verbs. But right now your stories sound like a robot. "I went. I came. I ate. I slept." We need glue. Sequence words. The first one: "First."

**Guest:** முதல்ல.

**Host:** முதல்ல. After that.

**Guest:** அதுக்கு அப்புறம்.

**Host:** அதுக்கு அப்புறம். Before.

**Guest:** முன்னாடி.

**Host:** முன்னாடி. Yesterday.

**Guest:** நேத்து.

**Host:** நேத்து. And today.

**Guest:** இன்னைக்கு.

**Host:** Now you're cooking. Let me show you the difference. Robot version: "I woke up. I drank coffee. I went to office." Human version: "முதல்ல எழுந்தேன். அதுக்கு அப்புறம் coffee குடிச்சேன். அதுக்கு அப்புறம் office போனேன்." Hear the flow?

**Guest:** முதல்ல எழுந்தேன். அதுக்கு அப்புறம் coffee குடிச்சேன்.

**Host:** Beautiful. Now add the logic layer. Why did you go? Because. 

**Guest:** ஏன்னா.

**Host:** ஏன்னா. Therefore.

**Guest:** அதனால.

**Host:** அதனால. But.

**Guest:** ஆனா.

**Host:** ஆனா. And the most satisfying word in Tamil. The word that ties it all together. That's why. Exactly. 

**Guest:** அதான்.

**Host:** அதான். This word is gold. When someone tells you a long story and you want to show you understood, you say...

**Guest:** அதான்.

**Host:** Exactly. When someone explains why they were late, and you want to say "that's exactly why I was worried," you say...

**Guest:** அதான்.

---

**Host:** Boss fight time. I'm your wife. You came home late. I ask you: என்ன பண்ணினீங்க? What did you do today? Tell me your day. Use at least three sequence words and one connector. Go.

**Guest:** முதல்ல office போனேன். Meeting பண்ணினேன். அதுக்கு அப்புறம் lunch சாப்பிட்டேன். ஆனா traffic ஜாஸ்தி. அதனால late ஆச்சு.

**Host:** That was genuinely impressive. You just told a complete story in Tamil with sequencing, a "but" clause, and a cause-effect conclusion. That's not tourist talk. That's conversational.

**Guest:** அதான்!

**Host:** Ha! Using it against me. Good.

---

**Host:** One more weapon before we go. The most important question in Tamil. The question that is never really about food.

**Guest:** What is it?

**Host:** சாப்பிட்டீங்களா?

**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டீங்களா?

**Host:** Did you eat? But it doesn't mean "did you eat." It means "I care about you." It means "I'm checking on you." It means "are you okay?" Every phone call from a Tamil relative starts with this. Every. Single. One.

**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டீங்களா?

**Host:** If you have eaten, you say:

**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டேன்.

**Host:** If you haven't eaten yet:

**Guest:** இன்னும் இல்ல.

**Host:** இன்னும் இல்ல. Not yet. And the perfect deflection — "I just ate":

**Guest:** இப்போ தான் சாப்பிட்டேன்.

**Host:** இப்போ தான் சாப்பிட்டேன். That "தான்" is the "just" in "just now." It's your shield against the infinite care loop.

---

**Host:** Final drill. Your mother-in-law calls at 2pm. She says — சாப்பிட்டீங்களா?

**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டேன்.

**Host:** Good. She asks what you ate.

**Guest:** Rice சாப்பிட்டேன்.

**Host:** She asks what you did before lunch.

**Guest:** முன்னாடி meeting பண்ணினேன்.

**Host:** She asks what you're doing now.

**Guest:** இப்போ rest பண்றேன்.

**Host:** She asks why.

**Guest:** ஏன்னா tired.

**Host:** She says okay, she'll call again at dinner.

**Guest:** சரி.

**Host:** Today's Zinger. The phrase you mutter at every doorway.

**Guest:** என்ன?

**Host:** நேத்து என்ன பண்ணினீங்க? What did you do yesterday? Mutter it three times. Every doorway. Let the past tense eat into your brain.

**Guest:** நேத்து என்ன பண்ணினீங்க?

**Host:** நேத்து என்ன பண்ணினீங்க?

**Guest:** நேத்து என்ன பண்ணினீங்க?

**Host:** You are no longer a goldfish. You have a past now.
