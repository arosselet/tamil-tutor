# Script: Level 4, Episode 2 — Past Verbs (Consumption)

**Host:** Welcome to Level 4. The Debrief.
**Guest:** The Debrief? Sounds serious.
**Host:** Very serious. So far, you have just been surviving in the present. You are in the auto. You are at the store. You are hungry right now. It's all reactive. But humans don't just react. We tell stories. We report back.
**Guest:** Ah. Past tense.
**Host:** Yes. You are no longer reacting; you are reporting the past. Today, we cover consumption. What did you eat, drink, watch, and do with your body? Let's start with the sonic signature of the past tense for "I". 
**Guest:** The sound of me doing something.
**Host:** Exactly. In Tamil, when you talk about yourself in the past, the verb almost always ends with a long "aen" sound. The "N" at the end is very soft, almost nasal. Say it with me. Aen.
**Guest:** ஏங்
**Host:** Aen. It's the sound of personal history. Let's start the timeline. The first thing you did today. You woke up. Ezhundhaen. Ezhundh-aen.
**Guest:** எழுந்தேன்.
**Host:** Listen to the end. "aen". Woke up.
**Guest:** எழுந்தேன்.
**Host:** A friend calls you at 11 AM completely confused why you didn't answer the door at 8. You say, "I woke up at 10". Focus on the verb. Woke up.
**Guest:** எழுந்தேன்.
**Host:** Yeah, jet lag is real. When I first moved to Chennai, my house help would violently bang on my door at 6 AM. I'd stumble out with red eyes at noon and just say "Ezhundhaen".
**Guest:** That sounds familiar.
**Host:** So if you wake up, eventually, what's the opposite? You sleep. The single most important activity. "Thoonginaen". Thoongin-aen.
**Guest:** தூங்கினேன்.
**Host:** I slept.
**Guest:** தூங்கினேன்.
**Host:** What did you do on the flight?
**Guest:** தூங்கினேன்.
**Host:** What did you do all of Sunday?
**Guest:** தூங்கினேன்.

**Host:** And now, Act Two. The most common questions you will face in India revolve around your stomach. The Ingestion Verbs.
**Guest:** I feel like I'm already interrogated about this.
**Host:** Wait until you can actually answer them! Let's start with liquids. I drank. Kudichaen. Kudi-chaen.
**Guest:** குடிச்சேன்.
**Host:** I drank coffee.
**Guest:** Coffee குடிச்சேன்.
**Host:** The ritual is sacred. The morning "Coffee kudichaen" status update is non-negotiable. If you haven't drunk it, the day hasn't started. I drank water. Water is thanni.
**Guest:** Thanni குடிச்சேன்.
**Host:** So, if "Kudichaen" is for liquids, the mighty verb for solids. The king of all Tamil verbs. I ate. Saapitaen. Saapit-aen.
**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டேன்.
**Host:** Let's practice. I ate Dosa.
**Guest:** Dosa சாப்பிட்டேன்.
**Host:** I ate Idli.
**Guest:** Idli சாப்பிட்டேன்.
**Host:** Okay, roleplay time. Your mother in law calls. Do you remember the ultimate care question from Level 1? Did you eat? Saaptingala?
**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டீங்களா?
**Host:** Yes. She asks, "Saaptingala?". What is your defense? What is your shield? Tell her you ate!
**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டேன்.
**Host:** Say it confidently. "Saapitaen!" It's basically the Tamil equivalent of "I'm doing great, everything is fine, thanks for asking".
**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டேன்!
**Host:** Exactly. Now let's loop them. I drank.
**Guest:** குடிச்சேன்.
**Host:** I slept.
**Guest:** தூங்கினேன்.
**Host:** I ate.
**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டேன்.
**Host:** I woke up.
**Guest:** எழுந்தேன்.

**Host:** Act Three. We cover the belly, we cover sleep. Now, the eyes. You consumed media, or you consumed a sight out in the world. "I saw" or "I watched". Paarthaen. Paarth-aen.
**Guest:** பார்த்தேன்.
**Host:** I watched a movie.
**Guest:** Movie பார்த்தேன்.
**Host:** I watched TV.
**Guest:** TV பார்த்தேன்.
**Host:** It also means "I looked" or "I saw". You saw an auto.
**Guest:** Auto பார்த்தேன்.
**Host:** Now, let's look at the double verification. Just like "Saaptingala?" means "Did you eat?", the word for "Did you see?" is "Paartheengala?". 
**Guest:** பார்த்தீங்களா?
**Host:** If your friend asks, "Did you see?" Paartheengala? Say yes. I saw.
**Guest:** பார்த்தேன்.
**Host:** Let's do the weekend debrief. Tell me four things you did yesterday. I woke up.
**Guest:** எழுந்தேன்.
**Host:** I ate.
**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டேன்.
**Host:** I watched TV.
**Guest:** TV பார்த்தேன்.
**Host:** I slept.
**Guest:** தூங்கினேன்.
**Host:** It's that easy. Notice how we don't even need the word "I". The "aen" ending tells everyone exactly who did the action.

**Host:** Act Four. Chaos simulation. A sneak peek at the next episode. Stringing these together.
**Guest:** Stringing them together? Like a story?
**Host:** Oh yeah. Let's build a sequence. No thinking. Just react. Someone asks what you did this morning. First, wake up.
**Guest:** எழுந்தேன்.
**Host:** Good. Now, drink coffee.
**Guest:** Coffee குடிச்சேன்.
**Host:** Eat dosa.
**Guest:** Dosa சாப்பிட்டேன்.
**Host:** Sleep again.
**Guest:** தூங்கினேன்.
**Host:** Listen to how simple a good day sounds when broken down into just past-tense verbs. Woke up. Drank coffee. Ate dosa. Slept.
**Guest:** It sounds incredibly peaceful.
**Host:** Now let's callback yesterday's magic word. Remember what to do if someone charges you too much?
**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி!
**Host:** Awesome. Listen carefully. I say, "I ate ten idlis." What do you say?
**Guest:** பத்து? ஜாஸ்தி!
**Host:** Perfect callback! Let's do the final rapid-fire validation. The Core Five of Consumption. Woke up.

**Guest:** குடிச்சேன்.
**Host:** Ate.
**Guest:** சாப்பிட்டேன்.
**Host:** Watched.

**Host:** Impeccable. You are no longer just surviving the auto driver, you're coming home and telling the story. 
**Guest:** Finally, I have history!
**Host:** Yes you do. Now for your threshold Zinger today. We want a high-dopamine phrase to mutter as you walk through doorways. Let's make it about sleep. Adding the word for "well" or "good" before the verb. "Nalla".
