# Script: Cousin Hangout — Casual Connections

**Host:** Alright, today we’re moving away from the formal polite "nga" for a second. We’re going to the terrace, grabbing a tea, and hanging out with your cousins. 

**Guest:** (Casual) என்னுங்கப்ப்பு! What's up! In the Kongu region, even with cousins, there’s a level of sarcasm that’s just... Goundamani-level legendary.

**Host:** Exactly. If you’re with peers, you don’t say *Vaanga*. You say *Vaada* for guys or *Vaadi* for girls. It's the "Comfort Zone" of the language.

**Guest:** But remember, if you use this with your father-in-law, you’re in trouble. Goundamani would say, "அரசியல்ல இதெல்லாம் சாதாரணமப்பா!" — but in family, it's a war.

**Host:** (Laughs) So, let's practice the "Peer Hook." 

**Guest:** *Vaada Mappillai!* — "Come on in, son-in-law/peer." Use it for cousins you’re close to.

**Host:** And the response?

**Guest:** *Enna da, eppidi irukke?* — "What man, how are you?" Notice the *da* at the end. That’s the peer signal. It's like Saying "Bro" but with more attitude.

**Host:** And if someone is being a bit too much, you drop the classic Kovai sarcasm.

**Guest:** *Romba panreenga-nga...* — "You're doing too much." Even in sarcasm, we keep the *nga* sometimes to make it sting more. Like Sathyaraj in a comedy scene.

**Host:** So, if your cousin asks you to help with something annoying?

**Guest:** *Vittu thallu da!* — "Just leave it, man." Pure leisure.

**Host:** Summary for the archive: *Vaada/Vaadi* for peers. *Ennu-ngappu* for that Kovai flavor. And keep the sarcasm high.

**Guest:** சரிடா. Let's hang out.
