# Script: Level 3, Episode 5 — BOSS FIGHT: The Vendor Stare-Down

**Host:** Welcome to the Boss Fight. No more drills. No more safety nets. Today, we drop you in the middle of T. Nagar market.

**Guest:** Sounds loud.

**Host:** It is. It’s chaotic, it’s hot, and everyone wants your money. Your mission: Buy five mangoes and get home without going broke.

**Guest:** I'm ready.

**Host:** You step out of your house. An auto pulls up. You get in. He asks "Enga?" (Where?)

**Guest:** T. Nagar போலாம்.

**Host:** He starts driving. He’s going too fast. You see the turn. You need to command him. "Go straight."

**Guest:** நேரா போங்க.

**Host:** He misses the turn! You need to correct him. "Left! Left!"

**Guest:** இடது! இடது!

**Host:** He turns hard. Now you see the market entrance. You need him to stop *near* the gate.

**Guest:** Gate கிட்ட நிறுத்துங்க.

**Host:** Perfect. "Gate kitta niruthunga." You get out. He asks for 200 rupees. You know it’s only 100.

**Guest:** நூறு ரூபாயா? இல்ல. நூறு எடுங்க.

**Host:** He grumbles but takes the hundred. You are now on foot. The crowd is pushing you. You see the fruit stall. The mangoes are piled high.

**Guest:** வணக்கம்.

**Host:** The vendor looks at you. He points to the ones on top. "Super mangoes," he says. "Mela."

**Guest:** மேல?

**Host:** But you look down. The ones *below* look better. "No, the ones below."

**Guest:** இல்ல, கீழ.

**Host:** He picks one up from the bottom. "Idhuva?" (This one?) You ask the price. "Evlo?"

**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?

**Host:** He looks at your shoes. He looks at your watch. He says: "Oru palam, pathu ruba." One fruit, ten rupees.

**Guest:** பத்து ரூபாயா?

**Host:** Actually, that’s a great price. But you can't accept the first offer! It’s about respect. You have to ask for less.

**Guest:** கம்மி பண்ணுங்க.

**Host:** He shakes his head. "Illa sir. Fixed price." You decide to go big. "Give me five."

**Guest:** அஞ்சு குடுங்க.

**Host:** He puts five in a bag. "Aim-badhu ruba." Fifty rupees. You hand him a hundred note.

**Guest:** நூறு.

**Host:** He gives you change. You have the bag. But now, where is your auto? You told him to wait... where?

**Guest:** வெளிய.

**Host:** Outside. You walk back to the gate. He is there. You hop in. "Veettuku polam." (Let's go home).

**Guest:** வீட்டுக்கு போலாம்.

**Host:** You did it. You navigated directions, handled the price, managed the inventory, and survived the negotiation.

---

**Host:** Debrief. You used numbers: அஞ்சு, பத்து, நூறு. You used positions: மேல, கீழ, கிட்ட, வெளிய. And you used the power words: நிறுத்துங்க, கம்மி.

**Guest:** I feel like a local.

**Host:** You're getting there. The market didn't eat you alive. That's a win.

**Guest:** Gate கிட்ட நிறுத்துங்க.

**Host:** Exactly. Keep that authority. See you in the next level.
