# Script: Level 3, Episode 6 — Rest and Reps (Urban Audit)

**Host:** Welcome back. You've been drinking through a firehose lately, so today, no new concepts. Just pure muscle memory. 
**Guest:** Thank god. My brain was starting to leak.
**Host:** We are focusing purely on the survival toolkit. Real scenarios in Chennai where hesitating for two seconds costs you money, or gets you lost. We are going to lock in the words from the "Rest and Reps" list.
**Guest:** Right. So, direction and money.
**Host:** Exactly. Let's start with the auto rickshaw. You've given the landmark, you're close to home, and now you have to guide the pilot. The two most critical words. Right and Left.
**Guest:** Okay, I always mix these up under pressure.
**Host:** We are going to fix that right now. Listen to the sound. "Right" is Valadhu. Valadhu.
**Guest:** வலது
**Host:** And "Left" is Idadhu. Idadhu.
**Guest:** இடது
**Host:** Good. Now you're in the auto. Your street is coming up. Tell him to go right.
**Guest:** வலது போங்க
**Host:** He didn't hear you. Say it louder! Right!
**Guest:** வலது
**Host:** Now you see the gate on the left. Tell him left.
**Guest:** இடது
**Host:** Now mix it with what we know from last week. Tell him to go straight.
**Guest:** நேரா
**Host:** Okay, gate is right here. Tell him to stop. Respectfully.
**Guest:** நிறுத்துங்க
**Host:** Let's pick up the speed. Straight!
**Guest:** நேரா
**Host:** Left!
**Guest:** இடது
**Host:** Stop!
**Guest:** நிறுத்துங்க
**Host:** Right!
**Guest:** வலது
**Host:** Perfect. No hesitation. If you mix up Valadhu and Idadhu, he turns into a one-way street, and the meter keeps ticking.
**Guest:** Yeah, last time I said left instead of right, he ended up in a market and I had to just get out and walk.
**Host:** Everyone has that story! Let's do a spatial speed round. Imagine the auto is moving. Stop!
**Guest:** நிறுத்துங்க
**Host:** Right!
**Guest:** வலது
**Host:** Left!
**Guest:** இடது
**Host:** Stop!
**Guest:** நிறுத்துங்க
**Host:** Excellent.

**Host:** That brings us to Act Two. You're out of the auto, which means it's time to pay. The transition to our next critical skill: Commerce. 
**Guest:** The worst part.
**Host:** Only if you don't know the words. The anchor phrase of all commerce is asking for the price. "How much?" Evvalavu. Ev-va-la-vu.
**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?
**Host:** With conviction. Like you already know the price and you're just testing him. How much?
**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?
**Host:** Excellent. You buy a tea. How much?
**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?
**Host:** You take an auto. How much?
**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?
**Host:** Now, if you are buying things, you need your anchor numbers. We are focusing on two extremes today. One. Onnu.
**Guest:** ஒன்னு
**Host:** And Ten. Pathu. Pathu.
**Guest:** பத்து
**Host:** Okay, let's combo this. You are at the tea stall. You want one coffee. You don't need a full sentence. Just hand gesture and ask for one.
**Guest:** ஒன்னு குடுங்க
**Host:** How much is it?
**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?
**Host:** The guy says it's twenty. You are buying it for a friend too. You want two. Do you remember two, from earlier? Rendu.
**Guest:** ரெண்டு
**Host:** Back to the anchors. One!
**Guest:** ஒன்னு
**Host:** Ten! 
**Guest:** பத்து
**Host:** Someone asks how many sugars in the tea. Say one.
**Guest:** ஒன்னு
**Host:** Let's roleplay. You walk up to the filter coffee stand. Order one coffee.
**Guest:** ஒன்னு குடுங்க
**Host:** He hands it to you. Ask him how much.
**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?
**Host:** He says ten. Repeat the number to confirm.
**Guest:** பத்து
**Host:** Beautiful.

**Host:** Now, here is the expat tax. If you say the number with an English accent, the price magically doubles.
**Guest:** Oh I know. I can see the mental arithmetic happening in their eyes.
**Host:** Yes! Which brings us to your shield. The ultimate weapon against the Expat Tax. The word for "Too much". Jaasthi. Jaasthi.
**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி
**Host:** Imagine a dramatic gasp. Jaasthi! 
**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி!
**Host:** You ask how much the auto ride is. 
**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?
**Host:** He says 500 rupees. That's ridiculous. Tell him it's too much!
**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி!
**Host:** Even better. You ask a fruit vendor how much the bananas are.
**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?
**Host:** He says a hundred. Nooru.
**Guest:** நூறு? ஜாஸ்தி!
**Host:** Excellent stacking! "Nooru? Jaasthi!" You are repeating his absurd claim of a hundred, and then destroying it.
**Guest:** I feel so powerful. 
**Host:** You should! I once had a guy try to charge me 500 for a single tender coconut just because I was wearing sunglasses. I took them off, looked him in the eye, and said "Jaasthi". He immediately dropped it to 50.
**Guest:** It's like a magic word.
**Host:** Let's practice the magic word. Auto driver wants 300.
**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி
**Host:** The rent is high.
**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி
**Host:** You are too tired. The tiredness is too much. 
**Guest:** டயர்ட் ஜாஸ்தி!
**Host:** YES. It works everywhere. It's the art of complaining mathematically. Remember from last week? If it's too much it's Jaasthi, what if you want them to make it less? Kammi!
**Guest:** கம்மி பண்ணுங்க
**Host:** Good. He says 200. You say Too much.
**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி
**Host:** You say make it less!
**Guest:** கம்மி பண்ணுங்க

**Host:** Okay, moving on to the final chaos drill. Real life doesn't happen in categories. Let's do a continuous scene combining directions with money.
**Guest:** I'm ready. My brain is switched on.
**Host:** You have arrived at the market in an auto. Guide him. Go straight.
**Guest:** நேரா
**Host:** Now right.
**Guest:** வலது
**Host:** Turn left.
**Guest:** இடது
**Host:** Perfect. Now tell him to stop.
**Guest:** நிறுத்துங்க
**Host:** You step out. Ask how much.
**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?
**Host:** He says four hundred. Give him the magic word!
**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி!
**Host:** He sighs and says okay, 100. Say okay.
**Guest:** சரி
**Host:** You walk over to a stall. You see some nice apples. You want one. Hand gesture and say one.
**Guest:** ஒன்னு
**Host:** He holds up ten apples. Say no, ten is too much! I want one!
**Guest:** பத்து ஜாஸ்தி! ஒன்னு குடுங்க!
**Host:** YES! Look at you stacking conditions! "Pathu jaasthi, onnu kudunga." Ten is too much, give one. 
**Guest:** It just clicked in my head.
**Host:** That's the muscle memory. You survived the market. Let's do a quick callback. Our zinger from the last episode was 'inside', Ulla. Tell the auto driver to go inside the street.
**Guest:** உள்ள போங்க
**Host:** Excellent recall. Now, the final rapid fire review of today's Core Six. Don't think, just speak. Right!
**Guest:** வலது
**Host:** Left!
**Guest:** இடது
**Host:** How much!
**Guest:** எவ்வளவு?
**Host:** Too much!
**Guest:** ஜாஸ்தி
**Host:** One!
**Guest:** ஒன்னு
**Host:** Ten!
**Guest:** பத்து
**Host:** Awesome job. We have cemented the survival layer. Tomorrow, we start negotiating the meter with 'Auto Rickshaw Diplomacy'. 
**Guest:** I definitely need that one.
**Host:** For your threshold today, the high dopamine phrase you should mutter whenever you cross a doorway: "Jaasthi!" Just complain to the universe that life is too much. See you next time.
