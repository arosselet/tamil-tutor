# Script: Kids Talk — The "Kutti" Vocabulary

**Host:** Today is a high-dopamine session. We’re talking to the little ones. The toddlers, the kids in your family. 

**Guest:** (Softly) ஆமாங்க. Talking to kids in Tamil is all about the "Kutti" energy. *Kutti* means small, but it’s a term of endearment.

**Host:** So, instead of saying "How are you?", how do we approach a child?

**Guest:** *Kutty paapa! Enna panreenga?* — "Little baby, what are you doing?" Notice we use the polite *nga* even with kids because it sounds cute and respectful in a Kongu way.

**Host:** It’s like we’re teaching them the politeness early.

**Guest:** Exactly. And if they’re eating?

**Host:** *Saapadu sapdu*?

**Guest:** (Laughs) No, say *Ammu kutty, sapdu-nga*. "Ammu" is a universal nickname for kids here. It’s warm. It’s like a hug in a word.

**Host:** What about the classic "Give me a kiss" or "Give me a hug"?

**Guest:** *Oru umma kudu-nga!* — "Give me a kiss!" Or *Inga vaanga-nga* — "Come here, dear." 

**Host:** It feels much softer than the "Street Tamil" we usually learn.

**Guest:** It is. Remember what Sivakumar says in his old movies—politeness starts at home. Use *Kutti*, *Ammu*, and *Paapa*. 

**Host:** If they’re being naughty?

**Guest:** *Ennunga-ngappa... summa irunga!* — "Hey... just be quiet/still!" It’s a playful warning.

**Host:** Alright, keep your tone soft, use the affectionate nouns, and don't forget the *nga* to make it adorable.

**Guest:** சரிங்க பாப்பா. Let's play.
