**Host:** So, looking at the technical architecture here, it’s clear this isn’t a standard language app. You’ve strictly ignored the formal curriculum. Why the pivot?

**Guest:** Because if you study from a traditional textbook, you end up sounding like a news anchor from thirty years ago. It’s what we call Senthamil. It’s elegant for poetry, but it’s a total mismatch for the streets of Coimbatore.

**Host:** Give me a specific example. What’s the delta between the book and the street?

**Guest:** Take the word for "I want." A book will spend three chapters teaching you வேண்டும். But if you say that to an auto driver, he immediately knows you’re a tourist. A local just says வேணும்.

**Host:** வேணும். It’s more clipped. More direct.

**Guest:** Exactly. Or "I am going." The formal version is போகிறேன். But on the street, we say போறேன். If you use the formal version, people will understand you, but they’ll treat you like a scholar or a stranger. We are building Operational Capacity. We want the sound of the street, not the library.

**Host:** And that leads into your 800 Lemma Theory.

**Guest:** Right. We identified the eight hundred verbs and connectors—the Glue—that run ninety percent of the connectivity. We don't waste any time learning Tamil nouns for modern objects. We use the Thanglish Hack. We take an English noun and plug it into a Tamil verb.

**Host:** So you just say "Office-uku போறேன்"?

**Guest:** Exactly. It sounds perfectly local. You’re using your existing English vocabulary as modules and just learning the Tamil operating system to run them.

**Host:** Let’s talk about the stack. This isn't a cloud-hosted system.

**Guest:** No, the source of truth is strictly local. It’s a set of Markdown files and JSON indices on my desktop. I have a Python script that parses these files and uses a dual-voice engine to generate these exact podcasts. 

**Host:** But you’re out for a walk right now. How does the system track your progress without a central server?

**Guest:** That’s the Mobile Sync Protocol. The AI on my phone acts as a remote operative. It generates a lean JSON blob of my session data—the words I mastered and the ones I struggled with. I share that JSON to a Home Assistant webhook on my private network. My desktop picks it up and updates the learner state automatically.

**Host:** It’s a totally private, local-first feedback loop.

**Guest:** Precisely. And the AI handles the pace through what we call the Sandwich structure. Every session starts with a Hook—a high-stakes scenario—followed by the Mechanics, then a Drill, and finally a Simulation. 

**Host:** And it adapts to your energy level.

**Guest:** Yeah. If my focus meter is low, we pivot to The Stream—passive listening. If I’m on fire, we go into Boss Fight mode. We’ve engineered the guilt out of the system with the Amnesty Clause. If I miss a day, there’s no makeup work. We just restart.

**Host:** And then there’s the muttering.

**Guest:** Quiet Broadcasting. It’s the ultimate somatic hack. We pick one Zinger a day, like நிறுத்துங்க. I don't study it; I just mutter it whenever I walk through a doorway. I’m anchoring the language to my physical movement. I’m moving the data from my logical brain into my muscle memory.

**Host:** So by the time you’re actually in Coimbatore...

**Guest:** My feet remember the words before my brain does.

**Host:** It’s a complete neurological overhaul.

**Guest:** கொஞ்சம் கொஞ்சம். Little by little. We aren't just learning a language. We are installing a new reflex.

**Host:** சரி. I think we’re ready to generate.

**Guest:** Let's trigger the build.
