# Script: Demo — The Tamil2 Protocol

**Host:** So, you’re looking at the system. You’re seeing the JSON, the scripts, the "Mobile Sync" buttons. And you’re probably wondering: why not just use Duolingo?

**Guest:** Exactly. Why build a custom engine just to learn some Tamil?

**Host:** Because we don't want "academic" Tamil. If you go to a class, they’ll teach you how to say "The fruit is on the table" in a way that makes you sound like a 19th-century poet.

**Guest:** (Laughs) Right. And nobody talks like that in Chennai.

**Host:** Nobody. Our philosophy is **Operational Capacity**. We use what we call the **Thanglish Hack**. Rule number one: use English for all the nouns. You don't need the Tamil word for "Fridge" or "Office" or "Auto." Just use the English one.

**Guest:** So what are we actually learning?

**Host:** The **Glue**. The verbs and the connectors. If you have the glue, you can stick any English noun into a sentence and it sounds local. Let’s demo some sounds from the first two weeks. 

---

**Host:** First, the basics. "Hello."

**Guest:** வணக்கம் (*Vanakkam*).

**Host:** And the most important word in the language. "Okay."

**Guest:** சரி (*Sari*).

**Host:** It’s not just "okay." It’s a vibe. It’s a shield. Someone’s talking too much? *Sari*. Someone wants you to do something later? *Sari*.

**Guest:** What about the "Kitchen" level? That’s where most people get stuck in the "Infinite Dosa Loop."

**Host:** Exactly. The host keeps feeding you until you die. You need the survival words. "It's good."

**Guest:** நல்லா இருக்கு (*Nalla Irukku*).

**Host:** And the word that actually saves your life: "Enough."

**Guest:** போதும் (*Podhum*).

**Host:** Say it with authority. *Podhum!*

**Guest:** And how does the tech work? How do we keep this lean?

**Host:** That’s the "Mobile Sync" protocol. We keep the phone bundle tiny—just JSON and text. The audio stays on the desktop. You listen on your walk, you give feedback to the AI on your phone, and it spits out a JSON blob. You tap "Share," it hits a Home Assistant webhook, and boom—your progress is synced back to the main system.

**Guest:** No cloud, no subscription, just pure local control.

**Host:** Just pure Operational Capacity.

**Host:** Today's Demo Zinger. The phrase to remember the "Glue" theory.

**Guest:** "Glue over Vocabulary."

**Host:** Or in Tamil: **கொஞ்சம் கொஞ்சம்** (*Konjam konjam*). 

**Guest:** "Little by little."

**Host:** Exactly. Little by little, the noise becomes a conversation.
